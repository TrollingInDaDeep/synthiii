	read external midi: reading midi is pain, as we are missing clocks
	if extmidiclock received -> extmode, if not, intmode
	handleclock -> serialprint -> misses Clock Signals while control surface loop runs
	ppqn, how?
	calculate bpm
	buffer [num ppqn]
	store [num ppqn] intervals
	remove highest 2 intervals
	calculate bpm / interval
	if missedclock -> increase counter
	next handleclock() does multiple Clocks (counter)
	Maybe: only react to Clock every so often (when swithc activated), then run on your own with same bpm


$ Drums:

1-9: bpm / n -> fill x step
* \ # -> 1/n or n/1

beat division = 24
4 beats = 96 ticks


initial value read (bool isinitial) in read function

$ Clocks
timerthree by Paul stoffregen https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimerThree
1. basic Clock + trigger (1 subclock) -> done
2. multiple subclocks -> prepared
3. division / mult -> ongoing
4. LP -> ???
